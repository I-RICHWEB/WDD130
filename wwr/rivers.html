        <h4 id="h4-para">The Hero group won the rafting competition at the Salmon River, Idaho, one of our favorite rivers. 
          The camping lasted for four days <span id="date"> (12th-15th February, 2022) </span>, it was filled with powerful experience. 
          The Hero group had higher number of first timers who weren't confident in rafting race, but to the amazement of everyone, their weakness opens 
          the door to unity. They selected and experienced member in their group to lead them. 
          They diligently followed his directives and success was theirs.

        <p id="f-p" class="river-para">This is the granddaddy of all canyons and the granddaddy of all river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
          Grand Canyon River rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient Indian ruins accessible only by river.
          CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.

        <p id="s-p" class="river-para">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the 
          mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. 
          This 84-mile trip runs from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, 
          interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
          Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
          Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.
