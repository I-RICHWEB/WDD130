            <h2>RELIGION HISTORY</h2>
            <p>I was born into traditional practice, as was both of my parents. Though we all participates in the ceremonies, but traditional practice was not a religion to be thought to children. therefore, we are often left out which gives us the privilege of seeking our own faith as we grow. I was first join to other christian denominations and was first baptize in the catholic faith before I became a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter days saints in 2009.</p>
